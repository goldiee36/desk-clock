.HW Components
* Arduino Pro Mini clone 3V3 8Mhz -> remove voltage regulator and power led, see picture
* 128x64 monochrome OLED display
* DS3231 real time clock chip based module -> remove charger resistor and power led, see picture
* 14500 3.7V lithium battery
* a micro USB lithium battery charger module, resistor changed to 3R6
* three tactile push button
* DHT22 temperature/humidity sensor + 10k resistor between the Vcc and Data pins
* piezo beeper
* plastic case: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1860495

.HW wiring
* arduino vcc and gnd to battery
* DS3231 vcc to battery, gnd to D9
* OLED vcc to battery, gnd to D8
* DHT22 vcc and gnd to battery, data to D4
* buttons to gnd and D2, D3, D5
* beeper vcc to battery, gnd to D6
* charger to battery

.SW calibration
* software have to be configured individually for each arduino, but only once
* measure voltage with volt meter (eg. 3.93 V)
* check voltage measured by the arduino by pushing the middle button (eg. 3.54 V)
* change correction value in the arduino code: measured/reported: #define VCORR 3.93/3.54;

.Features in software version v0.3
* button 1 short press put device in sleep --> almost no power consumption (~11 uA)
* power off automatically if the battery reading is below 3.5V (power on with the left or the middle button)
* change screen with short press of the middle button --> show temperature, humidity, time and battery voltage with different layouts (easy to configurable in the arduino code)
* on-time is up to 200 hours --> depends on the ammount of data (pixels) the screen have to display (700mA battery and only one data - like the time - on the screen with small numbers)

.Comments
* removing the resistor on the DS3231 clock module is needed if you use it with a CR3216 non-rechargeable battery as I do
* make sure you are using the included DHT library. Without that the temperature/humidity measurements will be slow, as the un-modded library is using millis() to measure time. If the un-modded library got a request within 2 seconds it sends back the last measurement without actually measuring anything. (DHT sensor measure interval is 2 seconds.) The problem is that with the power-off of the arduino the timers are not counting so millis() is measuring only the on-time, so the old library thinks that we are still in the 2 seconds window even if the arduino was sleeping for minutes.
* on the lithium charger module there is a resistor which tells the module how big the charger current should be. Usually these modules are shipped with a resistor (1.2 kOhm) for the 18650 batteries with 1A charging current. Changing the resistor to 3-4 kOhm will reduce the charging current to an acceptable level (400mA-300mA) for the capacity (700-1000 mAh) of the 14500 battery.
* I used a few windings of the CAT5 wire for the contact points of the battery holder
* I used a hot glue gun to fix the components into the case and CAT5 Ethernet wires the connect the pins. To save space I removed all metal pins from the boards like the oled display or the clock module.
* to set the time on the clock module use the included setTime.ino : upload it to the arduino board, open serial console, set speed to 155200 and enter the current date/time on the serial console like: 2017,1,6,15,42,45
