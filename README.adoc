.HW Components
* Arduino Pro Mini clone 3V3 8Mhz -> remove voltage regulator and power led, see picture
* 128x64 monochrome OLED display
* DS3231 real time clock chip based module -> remove charger resistor and power led, see picture
* 14500 3.7V lithium battery
* a micro USB lithium battery charger module, resistor changed to 3R6
* three tacticle push button
* DHT22 temperature/humidity sensor
* piezo beeper

.HW wiring
* arduino vcc and gnd to battery
* DS3231 vcc to battery, gnd to D9
* OLED vcc to battery, gnd to D8
* DHT22 vcc and gnd to battery, data to D4
* buttons to gnd and D2, D3, D5
* beeper vcc to battery, gnd to D6
* charger to battery

.SW calibration
* software have to be configured individually for each arduino, but only once
* measure voltage with volt meter (eg. 3.93 V)
* check voltage measured by the arduino by pushing the middle button (eg. 3.54 V)
* change correction value in the arduino code: measured/reported: #define VCORR 3.93/3.54;

.Features v0.1
* screen always on
* power off if the battery reading is below 3.5V (power on with the left or the middle button)
* show battery voltage if you push the middle button
* on time is more then 50 hours
